# Local Search Assignment

This assignement was for my intro to AI class. I was supposed to use the simulated annealing algorithm to solve to n-queens puzzle, using a heurisic function that measures the number of attacking queens as a cost function.  

I was then to run the algorithm using the following values:
 - T_threshold = .9, decayRate = .000001,
 - T_threshold = .75, decayRate = .0000001,
 - T_threshold = .5, decayRate = .00000001
    
I then had to run 10 trials for each value combination using a 4x4 grid, and then repeat that for an 8x8 grid and a 16x16 grid.  

I lastly had to print the initial and final board of each trial along with the initial and final h-value from the heuristic function
## n-queens puzzle:
Given a board of n by n squares, place n queens (from chess) so that none can attack each other

## Other Notes
Run the LocalSearch file for my code. The nqueens file was given to us to use to hand to puzzle part of the assignment.
The focus of the assignment was on using the simulated annealing algorithm to solve to the puzzle.
