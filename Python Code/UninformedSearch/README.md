# Uninformed Search Assignment
This was for my intro into AI class. I was supposed to perform a Breadth-First search and a Depth-First search of a given grid of ones and zeros (gridFile.txt), where zeros are open spaces and ones are walls.
I was then supposed to put the path of each given search algorithm in a file, pathBFS.txt and pathDFS.txt respectively. For bonus points, I could have the start and goal spaces taken from input into the console.

## gridFile.txt
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  
1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1  
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1  
1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1  
1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1  
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1  
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
